- canonical: FISHERS_EXACT_TEST
  synonyms: [fisher's exact test, fisher exact, fisher test]

- canonical: ANOVA
  synonyms: [anova, analysis of variance, f test, f-test]
  description: A statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups.

- canonical: MANN_WHITNEY_U_TEST
  synonyms: [mann whitney u test, mann whitney, mann-whitney u test, mann whitney u, mann whitney u-test]
  description: A non-parametric test used to compare differences between two independent groups when the dependent variable is either ordinal or continuous, but not normally distributed.

- canonical: WILCOXON_SIGNED_RANK_TEST
  synonyms: [wilcoxon signed rank test, wilcoxon test, wilcoxon signed-rank test, wilcoxon signed rank, wilcoxon signed-rank]
  description: A non-parametric test used to compare two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ.

- canonical: KRUSKAL_WALLIS_H_TEST
  synonyms: [kruskal wallis h test, kruskal wallis test, kruskal-wallis h test, kruskal wallis, kruskal-wallis]
  description: A non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann-Whitney U test when there are more than two groups.

- canonical: FRIEDMAN_TEST
  synonyms: [friedman test, friedman, friedman two-way anova, friedman two-way anova test]
  description: A non-parametric test used to detect differences in treatments across multiple test attempts. It is the non-parametric equivalent of the two-way ANOVA.

- canonical: PEARSON_CORRELATION
  synonyms: [pearson correlation, pearson's r, pearson's correlation, pearson correlation coefficient]
  description: A measure of the linear correlation between two variables, giving a value between +1 and -1 inclusive.

- canonical: SPEARMAN_RANK_CORRELATION
  synonyms: [spearman rank correlation, spearman's rho, spearman correlation, spearman's rank]
  description: A non-parametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.

- canonical: KENDALL_TAU
  synonyms: [kendall tau, kendall's tau, kendall rank correlation, kendall's tau coefficient]
  description: A measure of ordinal association between two measured quantities. It assesses the strength and direction of association that exists between two variables measured on at least an ordinal scale.

- canonical: LOGISTIC_REGRESSION
  synonyms: [logistic regression, logit model, logit regression, logistic model]
  description: A statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

- canonical: LINEAR_REGRESSION
  synonyms: [linear regression, ordinary least squares, ols regression, linear model]
  description: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- canonical: COX_PROPORTIONAL_HAZARDS_REGRESSION
  synonyms: [cox regression, cox proportional hazards, cox model, proportional hazards model]
  description: A regression model commonly used for investigating the association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.

- canonical: SHAPIRO_WILK_TEST
  synonyms: [shapiro wilk test, shapiro-wilk, shapiro wilk, normality test]
  description: A test for normality in a distribution.

- canonical: MCNEMAR_TEST
  synonyms: [mcnemar's test, mcnemar test, paired nominal test]
  description: A test used on paired nominal data to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal.
